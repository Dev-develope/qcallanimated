                Modifying Section 14.7 of the Standard Terms, Provider may identify Customer and use Customers
                logo and trademarks on Providers website and in marketing materials to identify Customer as a

                industry-standard technology to de-identify Usage Data and Customer Content before such use.

                may be contained in Usage Data or Customer Content under Applicable Data Protection Laws.
